 For the past 40 years computer scientists generally believed that&nbsp;NP-complete problems are intractable. In particular, Boolean&nbsp;satisfiability (SAT), as a paradigmatic automated-reasoning problem, has&nbsp;been considered to be intractable. Over the past 20 years, however, there&nbsp;has been a quiet, but dramatic, revolution, and very large SAT instances&nbsp;are now being solved routinely as part of software and hardware design.&nbsp;In this talk I will review this amazing development and show how automated&nbsp;reasoning is now an industrial reality.I will then describe how we can leverage SAT solving to accomplish other automated-reasoning tasks.  Sampling uniformly at random satisfying truth assignments of a given Boolean formula or counting the number of such assignments are both fundamental computational problems in computer science with applications in software testing, software synthesis, machine learning, personalized learning, and more.While the theory of these problems has been thoroughly investigated since the 1980s, approximation algorithms developed by theoreticians do not scale up to industrial-sized instances.  Algorithms used by the industry offer better scalability, but give up certain correctness guarantees to achieve scalability. We describe a novel approach, based on universal hashing and Satisfiability Modulo Theory, that scales to formulas with hundreds of thousands of variables without giving up correctness guarantees.<br><b>Short Bio:</b><br>Moshe Y.
